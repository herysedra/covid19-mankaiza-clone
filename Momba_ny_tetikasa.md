## Momba ny tetik'asa covid19-mankaiza-clone

Ity tetik'asa eto @ GItHub ity dia manadihady ilay modely nampiasan’ilay ekipa alemana 
(Priesemann et al) sy ilay programa Python nozarainy malalaka (GNU General Public License) tato @ Github.

Asa atao eto:
A1: Manazava ireo code block tsirairay ao @ ilay notebook ;
A2: Manova ireo code block ilaina mifanaraka @ ireo antontan’isa MDG.
A3: Mamoaka modely sy programa mifanaraka @ antontan’isa MDG.

Fomba fiasa eto:
Ff1: Fomba fiasa GitHub no arahina (afaka jerena eto: herysedra/covid19-mankaiza-clone/My notes/Github and Python/Github.docx)
Ff2: GNU General Public License no arahina (afaka jerena eto: herysedra/covid19-mankaiza-clone/LICENSE), 
izany hoe malalaka tanteraka ny tsirairay ampiasa ny vokatra rehetra eto: hanova, hizara (na mety hivarotra aza).
Ff3: Ireo olona te hiara-hiasa eto @ ity tetik'asa ity dia afaka mandefa ny adiresy email-ny @ herysedra@yahoo.fr
 
NB: Am-pahany nalaina tao @ LiCENSE an’i Priesemann et al:
“Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. 
Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients 
the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights.”
